# Y7 Unit: P5.JS
###### The 3rd unit in the TES Secondary design (computing) class
This repo contains many files that each include code that is executable with the p5.js library, a library for Javascript that incorperates numerous drawing functions, etc.. Please note that all work here is originnal and has not included any copying from extenral websites other than the p5.js documentation (https://p5js.org/reference/) unless otherwise stated in comments.

# Table of contents
The projects are put in chronological order, based on when I started them.
## Ridiculous Rectangles
This is my first ever p5.js project, which includes rectangles that keep changing size and color. Careful! It's eye-blinding ðŸ¤£.

## Cookie Challenge
This project was a challenge from my Y7 Design teacher, Mr. Chin. The challenge? Re-create my 'Cracked Cookie Code' Photoshop poster from the Event Promotion unit, also from Y7.

## Bonkers with Beziers
This was inspired by the cool things that beziers can do. I was scrolling down the P5.JS documentation when I found that it could draw bezier curves, and decided to give it a go. The project isn't as cool as I would want it to be, but hey! This is just my 3rd project!!


## Grid Goofiness
This was an attempt at creating a grid that has squares that get highlighted when the mouse goes over it. It's not that cool but it's just a practice project!!!

## Art Arsenal
A procedural generation art creater with grids. This was the project I decided to go with after the Grid Goofiness project I made.
