# Y7 Unit: P5.JS
###### The 3rd unit in the TES Secondary design (computing) class
This repo contains many files that each include code that is executable with the p5.js library, a library for Javascript that incorperates numerous drawing functions, etc.. Please note that all work here is originnal and has not included any copying from extenral websites other than the p5.js documentation (https://p5js.org/reference/) unless otherwise stated in comments.

# Table of contents
The projects are put in chronological order, based on when I started them.

## ðŸ‘€ Some notes before you start
1. You can find the projects [here](https://github.com/Prestopy/p5js-y7/tree/main/code/p5.js%20code)! Or, you can just click on the headers. All the code is tested on the [editor.p5js.org](editor.p5s.org) website on the last date it was edited on.
2. My planning 'document' is here: https://app.milanote.com/1PCWxJ1dbfBJ24?p=3O5zq4jfrW8. Go check it out!

## [Ridiculous Rectangles](https://editor.p5js.org/King-click/sketches/AfbHwhp9d)
This is my first ever p5.js project, which includes rectangles that keep changing size and color. Careful! It's eye-blinding ðŸ¤£. **Backstory**: At first, I wanted to make a color pallete generator, but after I started and couldn't stop the boxes from changing colors every frame, I decided to go on the 'break-eyeballs' pathway and make rectangles that blind people, so I made the rectangles be able to change size and adapt to that, as well as let the user decide the amount of rectanlges by changing one variable. I also allowed the user to control the max RGB randomization for each box (color randomization controls).

## [Cookie Challenge](https://editor.p5js.org/King-click/sketches/L7kfS3HtN)
This project was a challenge from my Y7 Design teacher, Mr. Chin. The challenge? Re-create my 'Cracked Cookie Code' Photoshop poster from the Event Promotion unit, also from Y7. I didn't add the stock images in, but that's the rough plan of the positions of the pictures.

## [Bonkers with Beziers](https://editor.p5js.org/King-click/sketches/h7ikJSe9n)
This was inspired by the cool things that beziers can do. I was scrolling down the P5.JS documentation when I found that it could draw bezier curves, and decided to give it a go. The project isn't as cool as I would want it to be, but hey! This is just my 3rd project!! Apparently, it looks like lasers, according to my friend.


## [Grid Goofiness](https://editor.p5js.org/King-click/sketches/Bda1a3jBF)
This was an attempt at creating a grid that has squares that get highlighted when the mouse goes over it. It's not that cool but it's just a practice project!!! I started this project during an, I quote my friend, a very practical detention (it wasn't). I wanted to make a QR code, but then the website crashed and I had to restart, and I forgot how to make the color be retained, so I just turned this into a practice project :). Hey! I'm still working on commiting to projects I start.

## [Art Arsenal](https://editor.p5js.org/King-click/sketches/mttXnyCUH) (Work In Progress)
A procedural generation art creater with grids. This was the project I decided to go with after the Grid Goofiness project I made.

###### Plan of how the procedural generation will work. Typo in the title.
I wanted to do this after I saw someone make **marching squares** with p5.js. I don't know why because marching squares is not like this. It is far from this. I guess it just made me think of procedural generation?

## [Perplexing Parallax](https://github.com/Prestopy/p5js-y7/blob/main/code/p5.js%20code/perplexing%20parallax.js) (Work In Progress)
